Abstract
Procedural tree models have been popular in computer graphics for their ability to generate a variety of output trees from a set
of input parameters and to simulate plant interaction with the environment for a realistic placement of trees in virtual scenes.
However, deﬁning such models and their parameters is a difﬁcult task. We propose an inverse modelling approach for stochastic
trees that takes polygonal tree models as input and estimates the parameters of a procedural model so that it produces trees
similar to the input. Our framework is based on a novel parametric model for tree generation and uses Monte Carlo Markov
Chains to ﬁnd the optimal set of parameters. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of input models obtained from different
sources, such as interactive modelling systems, reconstructed scans of real trees and developmental models.

1. Introduction

vantages of procedural modelling for application to the production
process. Recently, various inverse modelling approaches have been
introduced. However, to the best of our knowledge, ﬁnding the parameters of a given stochastic procedural model of biological trees
has not been addressed by the computer graphics community. We
introduce a framework for stochastic inverse procedural modelling
of biological trees that offers three main contributions:

Plant modelling approaches can be categorized into three principal
classes: reconstructions from existing real world data, interactive
modelling methods and procedural or rule-based systems. The level
of realism of models produced by these methods is very high; however, many open problems still prevail.

r a new compact parametric procedural model that describes a

Trees created using the reconstruction and interactive methods are
typically static and do not react to varying environments. In contrast, procedural methods generate a wide variety of plants that can
be sensitive to the environment and adapt their shape to changing
conditions. However, the controllability of procedural models is low
and is typically achieved by creating a set of input parameters, which
is often a cumbersome manual process. This problem becomes even
more severe with the increasing complexity of procedural models
needed today for the creation of large realistic scenes. This drawback of procedural modelling can be alleviated by solving the inverse
problem, i.e. by automatically computing the parameters of a procedural model for a given tree. Once these parameters are determined,
the tree could be reconstructed and simultaneously enable all the ad-

wide variety of trees,

r an efﬁcient similarity computation for the comparison of two
trees, and

r a method for the automatic determination of input parameters of
the procedural model for a given input tree.
As shown in Figure 1, the input of our framework is a single
3D polygonal tree model (or a set of such models). Our framework
reproduces the visual appearance of the input as closely as possible
using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) optimization on the
input parameters.

Figure 1: An input polygonal tree model (a) has been processed by our inverse procedural modelling system and the input parameters of
the developmental model have been estimated so that it can produce stochastically similar trees (b–d). The developmental model is able to
produce environmentally sensitive trees models (e).
The input is approximated by the resulting procedural model with
its set of input parameters. We demonstrate our framework on various tree models and show how their procedural representation can
be used to generate more trees of the same species, trees of different
ages or trees grown under different environmental conditions.

2. Related Work
Plant modelling has been the focus of computer graphics research for a long time. Traditional methods are rulebased systems [Hon71, PL90], particle systems [RB85],
environmental sensitive automata [Gre89] and space colonization
methods [PHL*09, RLP07].
In the last decade some effort has been devoted to the reconstruction of real trees. Reche-Martinez et al. [RMMD04] use a
set of registered images to generate volumetric representations of
the tree canopy, and Neubert et al. [NFD07] work on loosely arranged inputs. In contrast to image-based methods, Livny et al.
[LPC*11] reconstruct trees from laser-scanned point sets (see also
[XGC07]).
Two recent approaches dynamically adjust tree models according to their graph skeleton. The ﬁrst approach proposed by Pirk
et al. [PNDN12] infers the early developmental stages from one
input exemplar and the second approach of Pirk et al. [PSK*12]
employs environmental sensitivity to static input trees and allows
the user to automatically change the tree topology under varying
environmental conditions. Both methods focus on an efﬁcient processing; the underlying developmental models only utilize a subset
of parameters required for a growth model and thus do not allow
generation of new tree models or adding branches. Their methods
do not allow for inferring all parameters that is required for a developmental model learning.
Sketch-based methods have been used to guide tree modelling [OOI06, CNX*08] by using biologically motivated rules to
infer the 3D structure of a tree from 2D input [LRBP12]. Other
interactive methods allow the user to control the modelling process
by changing a set of parameters. One of the ﬁrst user-aided methods is the work of Weber and Penn [WP95], and after it came the
Xfrog modelling system [LD99], in which rule-based and procedural modelling are combined to directly affect the model of a plant.

An overview of different modelling techniques has been presented
by [DL04].
The difﬁculty of controlling the rewriting process and the low intuitiveness of the rule creation lead to works that focus on the problem of inverse procedural modelling. Ijiri et al. [IMIM08] propose
a system that constructs a procedural model from an arrangement
of 2D elements. Stava et al. [SBM10] use transformation spaces to
build procedural rules that describe an arbitrary vector image. An
extension of this approach to 3D is presented by [BWS10]. In both
of these works, convincing procedural models could be obtained
only for highly regular and symmetric inputs, but not for stochastic
data.
Finding a set of parameters that would generate a given input
of a procedural model is a complex task. The parameters can be
estimated using optimization techniques such as the MCMC sampling [MRR*53]. This approach was used for ﬁnding the procedural representation of facades [RB06] or for directing the rewriting
process in procedural modelling [TLL*11]. Both methods rely on
a known procedural model with predeﬁned parameter values that
were used to compute the best model ﬁtting to the input data. Similar to our method is the approach of Vanegas et al. [VGDA*12] that
estimates input parameters of a procedural model. However, their
approach is aimed at interactive modelling of regular virtual cities
in order to provide high-level control and at matching stochastic
models. Moreover, Cournede et al. [CLM*11] present a method
that automatically detects parameters of stochastic procedural plant
models, but it relies on precise measurements of biomass distribution in real trees, which would be infeasible in computer graphics
applications.
3. Method Overview
To ﬁnd the computer graphics procedural representation for different
input trees, we need a procedural model powerful enough to generate
a variety of trees species. It is difﬁcult to reverse engineer an entire
model including its structural description but given an appropriate
parametric model many species can be expressed. This reduces our
problem to ﬁnding the right set of parameters for a given procedural
model that is able to generate trees resembling the input.
Our modelling framework (see Figure 2) uses either a single or
multiple geometric tree models such as LiDAR scans, Xfrog library

models, SpeedTree models or trees generated by Open L-systems.
The model is converted into a tree graph representation [GC98]
using an algorithm inspired by Au et al. [ATC*08].
We then use our procedural model that incorporates recent ﬁndings in plant biology and computer graphics (see Section 4). The
input parameters for the model are determined by maximizing a similarity measure that computes the visual and structural resemblance
of two trees (Section 5). This is done by MCMC-based optimization that proposes new parameter values that gradually increase the
similarity of the generated trees and ends when the parameters can
no longer be signiﬁcantly improved (Section 5.4).

4. Used Procedural Model
Trees have a wide range of shapes corresponding to various tree
species that can be represented by a developmental model with high
expressive power. Various developmental plant models exist, but
they often describe only a limited number of species.
We introduce a new parametric procedural model based on recent
advances in plant biology [CH06] and computer graphics [PHL09].
It uses a developmental formulation in which during each growth
cycle the tree grows shoots from active buds. The new shoots then
grow and create buds that can grow during the next cycle. The growth
of individual shoots and ﬂushing of buds is controlled using a lightbased model described in [PSK*12]. Note that one growth cycle
does not necessarily correspond to 1 year because some species
undertake multiple growth cycles per year [CH06].

4.1. Parameters
Our model is controlled by a set of 24 parameters ϕ̄ describing
effects of internal and external factors on the tree shape. The parameters belong to three groups: (1) geometric, (2) environmental
and (3) parameters determining bud fate. The geometric parameters
deﬁne shapes of particular plant organs such as internode length or
phyllotaxis and they are important for the overall plant shape. The
actual branching structure and density is controlled by the bud fate
parameters. Lastly, environmental parameters are used to describe
interaction of a tree with its environment, for example with light
and gravity.

੮RAM

Figure 3: Various parameters affect shoot growth: bending angle
ϕBAM, roll angle ϕRAM, and apical angle variance ϕAAV .
We have presented a moderately large parameter space for which
it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd the appropriate parameters for a target species
manually. Inverse modelling, with the help of a capable optimization
algorithm with efﬁcient sampling of the parameter space, provides
an automatic solution.
Geometric parameters represent properties of different tree
species on tree geometry. A group of parameters determines the
phyllotaxy of a tree. They control number and relative orientation
of lateral buds along a shoot as shown in Figure 3 and in Table 1.
Additional parameters describe the variance of individual angular
variables that add randomness into the generated trees. The apical
bud is always located at the end of the shoot, and its orientation
with respect to the parent shoot is determined by a spherical angle (θ, φ); {θ ∼ N (0, ϕAAV ), φ ∼ U(0, 2π)}, where N and U are
the normal and uniform distributions, respectively, and ϕAAV is
the apical angle variance parameter. Increasing its value adjusts
the branching structure as shown in Figure 4(a).
The shoot length is controlled by the growth rate (ϕGR ) and the
internode base length (ϕIBL ), which together determine the distance between two nodes containing lateral buds. The number of
internodes nIN generated by a single shoot is computed as rounded
growth rate nIN = ϕGR , and the length of a shoot is nI N ϕIBL .
The values of ϕGR and ϕIBL can change based on the location and
tree age. The initial internode length decreases with the increasing tree age [OL96] and is expressed by internode length age
factor (ϕIL AF ), which modiﬁes the actual internode length be
t
= ϕIBL ϕIL
cause ϕIBL
AF , where t is the age of the tree. The
age factor is usually smaller but close to one, which causes
the length of internodes to gradually decrease as the tree gets
older.
The growth rate of a shoot ϕGR is primarily affected by
the dominance of its parent branch, described by apical control (ϕAC ) [CBH09]. If its value is high, shoots growing from dominant branches grow faster than shoots growing from lateral ones,
resulting in a tall tree with a signiﬁcant trunk. Trees with a low apical control have a spherical crown as all branches grow with similar
speed (see Figure 4b). Apical control directly modiﬁes the growth
rate

Figure 4: (a) The effect of increasing branching angle (from left to right); (b) a tree with high apical control (left) has a long trunk and
shorter side branches, whereas low apical control causes trees to have the typical spherical crown (right); (c) high apical dominance results
in less-frequent branching enabling certain branches to become dominant (left). A tree with low apical dominance tends to branch very often,
creating many equally dominant branches (right).
ζk is the level of the parent branch [BAS09]. More dominant
branches have lower levels. The value of apical control usually
decreases with increasing tree age, which allows the tree to form a
denser crown at the later stages of its growth [OL96]. We control
this time dependence with apical control age factor (ϕAC AF ), which
t

= ϕAC ϕAC
modiﬁes the original apical control as ϕAC
AF .
The parameters from the previous part deﬁne the geometric properties of individual branch segments, but the internal tree structure
is primarily deﬁned by the fate of its buds that is controlled by bud
fate parameters. A single shoot usually contains many buds, but not
all of them ﬂush and grow during the growth cycle. Some may stay

dormant until the conditions are favourable, or they might die as a
result of biological or environmental factors. During each growth
cycle, we set the parameters ϕAB D and ϕLB D , which specify the
probability that a given apical (ϕAB D ) or lateral (ϕLB D ) bud died
before the growth cycle started. Living buds can either form a new
shoot or remain dormant as a function on illumination and the plant
hormones [Sri02]. We represent the inﬂuence of light on apical buds
with the apical light factor ϕLF A and on lateral buds with the lateral
light factor ϕLF L .
The fate of a bud depends on the hormone auxin, which is produced and transported towards the root when a bud starts growing

122

into a new shoot. A high level of auxin inhibits lateral buds from
ﬂushing, effectively delaying the growth of side branches [CBH09].
This allows a tree to form more signiﬁcant branches that hold smaller
lateral branches. If the level of auxin is low, the tree branches more
frequently, thus creating a regular structure with high density and
without dominant branches (see Figure 4c). In real trees auxin also
controls the growth rate that is considered constant in our model.
We encode such apical dominance in three parameters: ϕ_AD_BF
is the apical dominance base factor corresponding to the amount
of auxin produced by a ﬂushing bud. The concentration of auxin
decreases as it is transported towards the roots, described by apical dominance distance factor ϕ_AD_DF. Apical dominance often decreases with increasing tree age, represented as apical dominance
age factor ϕ_AD_AF.
Apical dominance should not be confused with the apical control. Even though they are often used interchangeably, their cause
and their effect are different [CH06]. Apical control inﬂuences the
growth rate of a shoot, but apical dominance controls bud ﬂushing.
Apical control is used together with the light factors to compute the
probability P(F(b_i)) that a given bud b_i will ﬂush. For apical buds
the probability is:

```cpp
P(F(b_i)) = I(b_i)^ϕ_LF_A;
```

where I(b_i) is the illumination of the bud. It is computed using the
light model [PSK*12].

simulates the bending at each node of the grown tree by using the
orientation of the bent branch and the total mass of its child branches
(see Appendix A).

where (bi ) is a set of all buds located above the given lateral bud,
and δj = 1 if the bud bj ﬂushed and otherwise zero. The value of
d(bi , bj ) is the branch-wise distance (Section 5.2) between buds bi
and bj .
Environmental parameters deﬁne how the surrounding environment affects the plant. Light and gravity directly inﬂuence the
growth direction of a shoot. In normal conditions, shoots grow in
the direction deﬁned by their source bud, but the growing shoot can
bend towards or away from an impetus that is described by tropisms.
Phototropism (ϕ_PT) is bending towards light, and gravitropism (ϕ_GT)
is bending away from the gravity. The bending is simulated using
the approach from Palubicki et al. [PHL*09], where the parameters
ϕ_PT and ϕ_GT represent the strength of bending.
An increasing pruning factor ϕ_PF causes more intense shedding
of shadowed branches. Many branches are also removed due to
human or animal intervention, etc. We simplify these inﬂuences by
using a single parameter called low-branch pruning factor (ϕ_LB_PF).
It speciﬁes the maximal height up to which all side branches are
pruned.
As a tree grows older, the branches bend down in a response
to increasing weight of their child branches. The sagging of older
branches is especially important for many coniferous and other

Instead of directly simulating the growth of foliage we use a procedural system from Livny et al. [LPC*11]. The leaves are located
along the terminal branches. A certain species is assigned manually
to a model and additional branchlets are generated that hold the
leaves. This results in a higher foliage density, which is favourable
for scanned models of real trees because they usually contain only
the main branches. We used a set of leaf templates for many deciduous and coniferous trees, including willow, mahogany, pine and
thuja species. The leaves are generated at the end of the growth
cycle.

4.3. Example trees
Figure 5 shows the development of a tree achieved by our procedural
model. The individual images were captured with a time difference
of 5 years. Figure 6 shows several examples that were generated
using our approach by directly setting the parameters (see Table 2).
The variety of shapes has been achieved by changing the parameter
values, and each tree was generated using a trial-and-error approach
because the parameter space is large, and expressing the designer
intention in this way is difﬁcult.

5. Similarity Measure and Optimization
Having described our parametric model, we now want to focus on
how to ﬁnd a set of parameters that maximizes the similarity measure
between the input data and the generated trees. Although possible,
we make no attempt to optimize the environmental parameters of the

procedural model that are used for the synthesis of trees interacting
with the envirorunent.
Various similarity measures have been used in computer graphics and in biology. Some of them concentrate on the branching skeleton [FGOO] whereas others focus on the foliage rendering [NPDDll]. In contrast, we introduce a new similarity distance
that incorporates shape, geometry and structure and evaluates the
visual and structural differences between two botanical tree models
r 1 and r2 • Our similarity distance is composed of three different
components that measure the differences between the two trees at
three different quantitative levels: (1) the shape distance ds(r 1, r2 )

the geometric distance dG(r 1 , r2 ) compares the global geometric
branching properties and (3) the structure-based distance d 7 (r1 , r 2 )
detects local differences between individual branches based on their
position within the trees.
Pirk eta/. [PNDN12] proposed a geometric approach for estimation of tree parameters from polygonal models. Although estimating
some values directly from the model could speed up the optimization, we observed that the optimization time is not a bottleneck
and decided to use full optimization of all parameters from the
scratch. Moreover, our optimization works with any input model
and is not limited to models compatible with approaches presented
by [PNDN12].

5.1. Shape distance
Tite shape distance function evaluates several descriptors that define
the shape, as illustrated in Figure 7. The height of the tree r is
described by J...s,h{ r). Tbe crown shape is affected by the distribution
of leaf branches along the vertical axis of the tree. To capture the
variances in this distribution, we divide the tree into three horizontal
slabs as shown in Figure 7.
To find the separating planes, we first compute the geometric mean of tbe crown f.Lc that divides the entire crown into two

124
halves. The location of the separating planes is then defined by
the geometric means f.louh and J.loth of the upper and lower halves,
respectively.
For each slab, we compute a set of shape descriptors {A.s,c} that
capture their height h 1 , the average radius in the horizontal principal
directions of the crown rmin and r1ru1 1 , and their leaf-branch density,
where the leaf-branches are all tenninal branches. Having two trees
1:1 and 1:2 , we first compute the differenceso,5 between all descriptors

where <'>.s,; is a normalization factor that ensures comparability of
different descriptors. Based on our experiments we set the normalization factor to <J>.s,; = -k min (>..s,t(< 1), As,t(<z)), which resulted in
a fast convergence during the optimization process.
T he shape distance is then computed as the Minkowski distance
of order p of the vector gs to the origin. If p = I, the distance is essentially just an averaged sum of the differences, and with increasing
p, the weight of larger differences increases. From our experiments
we set p = 2.5, which gives a noticeably higher importance to large
differences without significantly degrading the impact of the lower
ones.

5.2 . Geometric dista nce
The shape of two trees can be similar even if there are noticeable
differences in the geometric properties of their branching structures.
The geometric properties of a tree are defined by the statistics of the
geometry of its branches and by their relative orientation.

We obtain geom etl"ic d escl"i pto1·s from the geometric properties
described in Table 3. All geometric properties, except the branch
length and thickness, are calculated by using sample points over the
tree. T he descriptors are defined as the weighted mean and variance
of these samples.
The sample weight of the geometric attributes is computed using
the length and the thickness of the given branch and reflects the
different impacts of smaller and larger branches on the similarity
between the two trees. For angular properties (sibling and parent
angles), the weights are computed directly from the branch thickness
as either w~ = b 0 or w~ = b1. The remaining branch properties are
weighted with w~ = bvbL and wZ = b1bL· The weighting scheme
w" denotes the dominant variation that puts more focus on the main
branches, while the weights w' capture characteristics of smaller
branches that form the foliage. By using two different weights for
each branch property, we compute two different sample means and
variances for every geometric attribute.
The sample means and sample variances are then used as geometric descriptors AG that are used to compute the geometric distance
dG using the Minkowski length, as shown in Equation 4.

5.3. Structu1·al djstance

5.2 .1. Branch geometry
Properties of branch geometry are computed from the tree graph.
Each branch is described by a set of properties {bt} (see Table 3)
that are computed from the geometric information of the branches,
as illustrated in F igure 8.

The third form of metrics evaluates the difference between individual branches with respect to their position within the tree. Ferraro
and Godin [FGOO] evaluate distance between two tree graphs as
a minimal cost of transforming all nodes of one tree graph into
nodes of the other (the so-called edit distance). The nodes could

be transformed by operators: assign, insert and delete with a
cost γ defined by the geometric properties of the transformed nodes.
Operator assign maps one node from the source tree to a single
node of the target tree while operators insert and delete create
or erase a node from the target tree, respectively. The distance
between the two trees is given by a sequence of operators s
that transform one tree into the other one at the minimal cost:

```cpp
d = min_s Σ_{x_i ∈ s} γ(x_i);
```

(see an example in Figure 9). This method
works correctly when the distribution of nodes is uniform but it
quickly loses its accu111Cy when the geometric resolution between
the two tree graphs differs, i.e. when one model is modelled in much
coarser resolution than the other.

Figm·e 10: To map the left input tree to the right one (a), we first
apply the merge operator to fuse two nodes of the left tree and map
them onto a single node of the right tree (b). We then split one node
of the left tree to map tile result to two nodes of the right tree (c). To
compute the cost of the split operation., we apply the node joint :J to
the two nodes of the right tree and the resulting node is compared
to the original node of the left tree (d).

modify the cost of the implicit assign, insert and delete operations
that are performed during each split and merge step. The cost of the

5.3.1. Split and merge operators
To address the problem of different geometric resolutions in structural tree distances [FGOO]. we propose new ope111tors that compare
tree g111phs with inconsistent and irregular topologies. We define
two new ope111tors split and merge that replace the ope111tors ii!Sert
and delete:

YD(tt ),

(6)

Vtc ETrl.j

where YA• Yr and YD are the assigning, inserting, and deleting costs.
The ope111tor :1 (ta, tb) is a so-called node join operator that fuses
two nodes ta and tb and creates a new node ta .....b with combined
geometric properties of the original nodes (see Appendix B).

5.3.3. Edit dista11ce
• Split: Xs(t,, tz, tz,l) divides one node t 1 from the first tree r 1 into
two nodes that are assigned to two nodes of the second tree:
tz and its ith child node tz, 1• All subtrees T,2_1 with roots in all
remaining child nodes t2,1 , {j ::f. i} are then inserted into the first
tree.
• Merge: XM(t,, t1,1, tz) is the inverse operator of the split ope111tor.
It merges a node t1 from the first tree with one of its child nodes
t1,1· The merged nodes are then assigned to a single node t2 from
the second tree. All remaining subtrees Tr,,, rooted in child nodes
t 1,1 , {j ::f. i} are deleted.
An example of the application of ope111tors on a tree g111ph is in
Figure I 0. Because both ope111tors can be applied repeatedly, they

effectively connect chains of subsequent nodes.

5.3.2. Operator cost functions
From a structural point of view. the new operators provide no new
benefits because the sante output can be achieved by a sequence of
insert, delete, and assign operations. However, each use of a split
or merge operator effectively changes the geometric properties of

The distance between two tree graphs T_1 and T_2 is equal to the minimal cost of transforming one tree graph into the other. The cost of
such a sequence can be computed by a recursive algorithm [Zha96]
that evaluates the so-called edit distance d_N(t_1, t_2) where t_1 is the
root of T_1 and t_2 is the root of T_2. Computing the edit distance
between unordered trees is generally an NP-complete problem, but
it can be solved in polynomial time when proper constraints are
defined [Zha96] (see Appendix B for a discussion of the constraints
used in our implementation).
To compute d_N(t_1, t_2), we modified the algorithm. When either t_1
or t_2 is an empty node, we compute the edit distance using the original approach, but the edit distance between two nonempty nodes t_1
and t_2 is now defined using the new operations split and merge:

```cpp
d_N = min(
    γ_A(t_1, t_2) + d_F(t_1, t_2),
    d_F(ε, t_2) - max_{t_2,i} (d_N(t_1, J(t_2, t_2,i)) - d_N(ε, t_2,i)),
    d_F(t_1, ε) - max_{t_1,i} (d_N(J(t_1, t_1,i), t_2) - d_N(t_1,i, ε))
);
```

where dF (t1 , t2 ) is the distance between two forests that are
created from subtrees of nodes t1 and t2 after the nodes have
been removed. We compute dF (t1 , t2 ) by solving the mincost
max-ﬂow problem on a bipartite graph as described by Zhang
[Zha96].

The ﬁnal similarity measure D_T(τ_1, τ_2) is the sum of shape-based,
geometry-based and structure-based distances with corresponding
weights w_S, w_G, w_T ∈ [0..1], where w_S + w_G + w_T = 1:

```cpp
D_T(τ_1, τ_2) = w_S * d_S(τ_1, τ_2) + w_G * d_G(τ_1, τ_2) + w_T * d_T(τ_1, τ_2);
```

A value D_T = 0 reﬂects the exact similarity and 1 no similarity at all. All our results
were generated for equal weights. Better results can be achieved if
the weights are selected by the user for a speciﬁc problem. For
example, if she is interested in the similarity of the tree crowns, the
shape-based weight w_S can be increased while the remaining two
weights are decreased.
5.4. Optimization of parameters
A procedural model M is essentially a stochastic system, and each
tree τ generated by the model is a realization of this system that is
controlled by the parameters ϕ̄ and the time t: τ M (ω) ∼ M(ϕ̄, t),
where ω{ω ∈ M } is the state variable of M deﬁned in the state
space M . In general, there can be inﬁnite number of trees that can
be generated by the system M, where the probability that a given
tree is generated is determined by some density function p(ω).
To ﬁnd the model parameters that maximize the resemblance of
the generated model to the input tree, we maximize the similarity measure by minimizing the distance function DT (τ1 , τ2 ). The
optimization problem is then deﬁned as

Figure 11: Optimization of the tree distance.
where ωj are the random samples following the density p(ω) that
is speciﬁc for every model M(ϕ̄, t). The number of samples ωj
determines the accuracy of the approximated solution, as discussed
in Section 6.
Because the relation between the model parameters ϕ̄ and the
distance DT is unknown, we have to solve the optimization problem
from Equation (9) indirectly using one of the stochastic or heuristics
optimization methods. In our work we use the Simulated Annealing
algorithm that is based on stochastic sampling of the parameter
space using the Metropolis-Hastings sampling strategy [MRR*53].

where τ r is the reference input tree. The above formulation searches
the optimal parameter values ϕ̄ and the optimal growth time t that
minimizes the distance for all trees that can be generated by the
parametric model M. To compute the distance of all trees, we need
to integrate over all possible states ω that are allowed by the model
M with parameters ϕ̄ and time t.
The integral of the distance function over all possible generated
trees cannot be solved analytically, but its solution can be approximated by the Monte Carlo numerical integration technique. The
approximated solution is then computed by randomly sampling the
state space M , where each sample represents a single generated
tree τ M . Since the random samples follow the probability density
function p(ω), the approximated optimization problem can be written as

The value of ζ_i is the temperature speciﬁc for a given iteration i.
The Simulated Annealing algorithm starts with ζ_0 set to a maximum
temperature ζ_max and the temperature is then linearly decreased until
it reaches 0 for the last iteration i_last. For all our examples we used
values ζ_max = 4 and i_last = 7500. The convergence of our method
for two results is shown in Figure 11.

various sources. The time required to process the input models is
summarized in Table 4. The optimization was performed by gen**Table 4: Processing time for different tree models.**

erating eight sample trees for each input model (see Equation (9))
that provided enough variation to sufﬁciently capture the shape of
the input trees.

6.1. Input models
6.1.1. Plant libraries
Plant libraries created by using interactive systems belong among
the most common sources of tree models. To capture this resource
we applied our method on trees that were obtained from the Xfrog
library [DL04]. Because of the nature of direct modelling techniques, the trees often contain repetitive regular small branches that
cannot be represented exactly by a stochastic model. Although the
structure of the smaller branches might not be recreated properly,
it was possible to faithfully model the overall appearance of these
inputs, as shown in Figure 12.

6.1.2. Scanned tree data
An important class of models consists of polygonal models of real
trees that were reconstructed from scanned data [LYO10, LPC11].
They represent mostly young trees with relatively sparse branching
structures; otherwise they could not have been effectively scanned.
The input data typically contain only a few most signiﬁcant branches
because the smaller ones were difﬁcult to retrieve. Although the
missing data poses a problem to inverse procedural modelling, we
were able to capture the shapes and structures of many of the analysed models, as seen in Figures 1 and 13.

6.1.3. Developmental models
Tree models can be also created using developmental rule-based
systems that are also used in biology. We have tested an Open Lsystem approach by Měch and Prusinkiewicz [MP96]. Although the
Open L-system description is developmental and uses internally a
set of rules with input parameters, our system was able to ﬁnd a set
of parameters that generates models with high similarity using our
developmental model, as shown in Figure 14.

6.1.4. Environmental interaction
An important property of our framework is that the trees are
represented as a growth model with a set of parameters. This
allows the tree to develop while interacting with the surrounding environment, as shown in Figure 15. When trees are reconstructed while standing in close proximity, the competition
for light prunes the colliding branches as shown on the middle
tree. If a tree grows close to an obstacle, any shadow cast by
the obstacle will cause signiﬁcant shape alterations. This adds
an important developmental property to otherwise static input
models.

6.2. Limitations
Our technique has been successfully applied to obtain a procedural representation of many input geometric trees. Nevertheless,
our method can be thought of as an example-based approach,
and it fails to produce good results when the input data does not
provide sufﬁcient information, such as missing branches or incorrect topology. These problems could be resolved, at least partially, if the distance functions are modiﬁed to provide explicit information according to the speciﬁc characteristics of such input
data.
The analysis of trees from model libraries revealed other
issues. The inverse method was unable to accurately capture
the regular nature of some input trees. To solve this problem, it would be necessary to add a support for these branching patterns into the developmental model. However, such regularity can make the reusability of resulting procedural models
problematic.
Since our procedural model is stochastic it can generate a wide
variety of trees for a given set of parameters. However, it cannot
reproduce the input model exactly. Furthermore, the inverse procedural approach is tied to our model. Our set of parameters allows
generation of a large amount of output trees. However, there may be
a tree species that is not captured by our procedural model. If such
a case arises, it would be necessary to extend the procedural model
accordingly.

7. Conclusion and F utm-e Work
We have introduced an approach to inverse procedural modelling of
trees. Our approach uses an ad hoc developmental model that captures a wide variety of tree species. Our inverse procedural framework automatically detects the parameters that generate a tree by
maximizing similarities between the input trees and generated tree.
We have shown that our approach can be used to obtain the procedural representation of various tree species using inputs ranging
from developmental models using L-systems, to scanned and reconstructed data, and even to hand-modelled trees from plant libraries.
Because the underlying procedural model is stochastic, for a given
set of parameters it generates a set of similar trees. Because of this
property, the inverse system cannot precisely reproduce the sante
structure of the input tree. To achieve this, we would need to control
the stochastic growth of the procedural model so that all random
parameters generated during application of the rules were replaced
by fixed values. This is essentially another optimization problem,
and it was addressed in a similar context by Talton eta/. [TLLI 1].

Lastly, ifJGBS denotes the gravity-bending strength. The actual effect
of the bending force on the orientation of the branch depends on
tlte thickness at the given node Po and on the accumulated bending
angle fJ<1- 1l(p0) that the branch bas already been subjected to until
timet.
The thickness d(p0 ) is used to compute the maximal bending
angle of a single branch as

with an orientation ii, we first compute the bending force fb on node
Po as

where Po is the location of the node p 0 , me is tlte mass of supported
branches with its centre at pointe, vector iiH is the horizontal portion
of the normalized branch direction h, and g is the direction of gravity.

The new bending angle fJ(p0) applied to the branch is
fJ(po) = max

(o, /Jmaxexp ( - ~:~) -

fJ(t-l )) ,

and the new accumulated bending angle fJ(Il(p0) is then

With the increasing accwnulated bending, subsequent bending becomes more difficult. Also, as the tree grows older, the bending is
hampered by the increasing thickness of the older branches.

Appendix B: Operator Cost Function Details
To compute the structural distance in polynomial time, the cost
of individual operators needs to be properly constrained [Zha96].
In our implementation the cost of joining two nodes J (ta , tb )
has to be deﬁned so that γD (J (ta , tb )) ≥ γD (ta ) + γD (tb ), and
γI (J (ta , tb )) ≥ γI (ta ) + γI (tb ). In other words, deleting or inserting
a combined node should not cost less than the total cost of deleting or
inserting its original components. We compute the geometric properties of J (ta , tb ) by applying the formulas from the last column of
Table 3 on the fused tree graphs. Geometric properties such as
length, thickness and slope of the branches are used to weight the
costs of γA (tk ), γI (tk ) and γD (tk ).
The cost of deletion or insertion of node tk is computed from
the total length bL (tk ) and thickness bT (tk ) of branches that are
contained within the node as χI (tk ) = χD (tk ) = bL (tk )bD (tk ). To
compute the cost of assigning node t1 to node t2 , we ﬁrst deﬁne

where s(t1 , t2 ) is the dissimilarity factor between branches contained
within nodes t1 and t2 . The dissimilarity factor is the normalized
Minkowski distance of a set of local differences δB that compare
slope (bS ), straightness (bT ) and deformation (bα ) of the branches
represented by nodes t1 and t2 . The differences are computed using
Equation (4). The dissimilarity factor is then

where k is the number of used local differences and p = 2.5 is the
order of Minkowski distance. With increasing dissimilarity or with
increasing difference in the lengths bL of the compared nodes, the
value of γA (t1 , t2 ) converges to the combined cost γD (t1 ) + γI (t2 ).
